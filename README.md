  Official Website Repository for TechLabs Global
</h1>

## üöÄ Quick start

We use Gatsby.js to build our Site

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install the Gatsby CLI `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
3. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.development` file
4. Get the contentful access token from passbolt and add a line to the `.env.development` file, replacing the XXX with the contentful token: `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXX`
5. Run `gatsby develop` to start the project locally

## Publish Changes

Staging branch automatically deploys to the staging environment and the production branch automatically to the production environment.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Content

We use Contentful as a CMS (Content Management System). There you can edit the location page of your TechLabs Community and add the BlogPosts.

## Location Pages

Currentliy the only pages that are generated are /location. In the templates folder you could find the template for the pages, which are generated from the gatsby-node file.

Any change in the content of the location pages has to be done through contentful.

## Translation

Please make sure to add static text both in german and english. Therefore you have to add a formattedMessage with the key to the json in intl/de.json and intl/en.json.

Example:
`<FormattedMessage id="about.about.program_hero.headingSecond" />`
